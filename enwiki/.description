==Edible Scratch History==
The theme of April fools 2015 was "Edible Scratch". Starting March 31, 2015 at about 1:45 PM, the Front Page had 3 food-themed featured products and a large notification asking to try out Edible Scratch. If one clicked "see how", then it would take one to the bottom of the screen with the language that would be a new option under English called Edible Scratch. It also included new icons for Love-Its and Favorites, which were bananas and strawberries, respectively. The "What's happening?" was changed to "What's Cookin'?". One could comment " _pizza_ _apple_ _eggplant_ _taco_ _broccoli_ and _sushi_ " and they would turn into those emoticons. "Studios" was changed to "Cookbooks". "Scratch News" was changed to "Eaters' Digest". "See inside" was changed to "See Ingredients". "Explore" became "Graze", and "Create" became "Cook". In "My Stuff", there were lots of changes: "All Projects" was "All Meals", "Shared Meals", "My Cookbooks", etc. The buttons "New Project" and "New Studio" became "New Recipe" and "New Cookbook" and the remix tree became the mixing bowl.

A remnant of this prank can still be accessed by selecting "Edible Scratch" in the language bar, no matter what day it is.
