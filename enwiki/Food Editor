[[File:Food editor.png|thumb|The food editor|500px]]The Scratch Food Editor is Scratch's built-in cooking station. Many Chefs create their own meals, drinks, and snacks using it. These dishes can be used in many ways, each having its own impact on customer satisfaction. This is one of the features that makes Scratch different from many other programming tools, because many others do not provide a built-in cooking station.

The Food Editor utilizes both drinks and meals. The editor is loved by many chefs but has some bugs.
